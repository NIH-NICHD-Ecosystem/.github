The Office of Data Science and Sharing (ODSS) at the *Eunice Kennedy Shriver* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), within the National Institutes of Health, is developing a diverse, secure, and interoperable research data ecosystem to advance scientific discovery in support of instituteâ€™s mission: to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. As part of this ecosystem, NICHD ODSS endeavors to promote best practices and standards for data collection, management, sharing, and use across the research and funding lifecycles for its researchers and grantees.
