The Office of Data Science and Sharing (ODSS) at the *Eunice Kennedy Shriver* National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD), within the National Institutes of Health, is developing a diverse, secure, and interoperable research data ecosystem to advance scientific discovery in support of the instituteâ€™s mission: to understand human development, improve reproductive health, enhance the lives of children and adolescents, and optimize abilities for all. As part of this ecosystem, NICHD ODSS endeavors to promote best practices and standards for data collection, management, sharing, and use across the research and funding lifecycles for its researchers.

<summary> Text description of the ecosystem graphic </summary>
In collaboration with NICHD, NIH, and external stakeholders, NICHD ODSS will build a federated, secure research and specimen data ecosystem that will measurably and rapidly facilitate data and specimen sharing by NICHD-funded researchers and increase access to shared data and specimens for the entire research community.

<p><b> The NICHD Ecosystem Use Case Library tracks user stories, use cases, and efforts to improve capabilities across the ecosystem.</b></br> 
NICHD ecosystem <b>user stories</b> are recorded based on user needs sourced from across the organization. These stories are used to initiate <b>efforts</b> to fulfill user requirements. Each effort is described by one or more <b>use cases</b>, using Unified Modeling Language (UML) informed by User-Centered Design best practices. 

* [User Stories](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/UserStories/blob/main/README.md) allows you to browse by user-reported needs.  
* [Efforts](https://github.com/NIH-NICHD-Ecosystem/Efforts/blob/main/README.md) allows you to browse by efforts undertaken to implement functionality for ecosystem users.
